This is for System Administrator Test.

For the email alarm, once the script found big files (threshold of 35MB and above), 
an email will be sent to  alarm@animapoint.net. I am trying to send the email using 
the Google SMTP by using the postfix somehow I canâ€™t make it to work. I able to sent mail through locally, but not from SMTP. 
I believed I need more time to find the problem, to understand more on the configuration files for the SMTP setting and and 
some guidance to convey the idea into the working environment.
